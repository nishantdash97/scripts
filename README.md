# Scripts
Some Useful Scripts

To use them, after downloading it, run the terminal command
```
chmod +x scriptname.sh
```

and then after that you will be able to execute it like 
```
./scriptname.sh
```
or
```
./path/to/file/scriptname.sh
```

Remember to consider permission level when running these scripts!


# Setting it up
1. Get the scripts into a directory you want.
2. Run install_drake.
3. Move install_build an clear_build into drake-distro (this directory gets created)
4. Run install_build. (can use clear_build to uninstall the build if there were installation issues with the build).

## NOTE: 
> install_drake.sh will create a folder called drake_distro in the same directory as the script. For the other 2 scripts to work,they need to be in the same directory as drake-distro.
