Some Useful Scripts

To use them, after downloading it, run the terminal command
```
chmod +x filename.sh
```

and then after that you will be able to execute it like 
```
./filename.sh
```
or
```
./path/to/file/filename.sh
```

Remember to consider permission level when running these scripts!

## NOTE: 
> install_drake.sh will create a folder called drake_distro in the same directory as the script. For the other 2 scripts to work,they need to be in the same directory as drake-distro.
